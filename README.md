# DataGenerator
This project is aiming to generate some virtual data file to ease some test.
Almost divide the project into five parts.
the first part:Random
the second part:Distribution
the third part:Field
the fourth part:Generator
the fifth part:Writer

Random:
this part is aiming to generate different kinds of random numbers.
The design will refer to the UniformRandomNumberGenerator concept.
just three kinds:non-deterministic random number generator;pseudo-random number generator;quasi-random number generator;

Distribution:
this part will refer to the boost Library in C++.

Field:
this part will consider different needs of many domains.
Such as MAC Address,IP Address,Time and so on.

Generator:
this part will mix other parts to generate virtual data.

Writer:
this part includes serveral output methods.
it will support more file format and more efficient output methods.
